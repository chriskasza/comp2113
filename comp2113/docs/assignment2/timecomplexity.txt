The time complexity for all inserts and removals is consistant regardless of the size of the list because the list was implemented as linked list using a hash map.  A maximum of three elements are modified for all inserts and removals.  The keys in the hash map are the strings stored in the list and the values are objects containing the string and pointers to the previous and elements.
